description: 'Route conversation based on conditions and create dynamic conversation paths'
---

**What It Does:**
- Evaluates conditions to determine conversation direction
- Routes to different blocks based on variable values
- Provides fallback paths when conditions aren't met
- Enables complex decision-making in conversations

**Key Features:**
- **Condition Types**:
  - **Variable Comparison**: Check variable values
  - **Time-based**: Route based on time/date
  - **Caller-based**: Route based on caller information
  - **Custom Logic**: Complex conditional expressions
- **Multiple Paths**: Route to different blocks based on conditions
- **Default Path**: Fallback when no conditions match

**Configuration Options:**
- **Conditions**: Define multiple conditional checks
- **Priority**: Order of condition evaluation
- **Default Path**: What to do if no conditions match
- **Custom Logic**: Complex conditional expressions

**Testing Tips:**
- Test all condition types with various scenarios
- Verify routing logic and path selection
- Check default path behavior when no conditions match
- Validate complex conditions and edge cases

**Common Use Cases:**
- Routing based on caller type
- Time-based call handling
- Service level routing
- Geographic routing
- Priority-based escalation
