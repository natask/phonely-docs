- **Variables to Pass**: What data to transfer
- **Return Conditions**: When to return to original flow
- **Error Handling**: What to do if transfer fails

**Testing Tips:**
- Test flow transitions with various conditions
- Verify variable passing and data integrity
- Check return behavior and context preservation
- Validate error handling and fallback scenarios

**Common Use Cases:**
- Escalating to specialized flows
- Branching based on caller type
