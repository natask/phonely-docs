Phonely allows you to enhance your own live call workflows by integrating with Zapier to trigger automated actions during a call. This guide will walk you through setting up a Zapier block in Phonely’s live call actions.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Workflows Tab

1. Log in to your Phonely account.
2. Go to the **Agent Designer** section and click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Select the workflow where you’d like to add the Zapier block.

## Step 2: Add a Zapier Block

1. Identify the stage in your workflow where you want the Zapier action to trigger.
2. Click the **plus (+)** button at that stage.
3. Choose **Live Call Actions** from the menu.

\> **Note:** Live Call actions occur during the call, unlike **Post Call** actions, which happen after the call and have access to more data (e.g., call recording, transcript, summary).

## Step 3: Configure the Zapier Block

1. Add the Zapier block to your workflow and connect it to a preceding block (e.g., a question or appointment scheduling block).
2. When the Zapier block is added, you’ll see two fields:
   - **Webhook URL**: The URL used to send data to Zapier.
   - **Customizable Fields**: Define which fields (e.g., name, email, phone number) will be sent to Zapier.

## Step 4: Get the Webhook URL from Zapier

1. Log in to your Zapier account.
2. Create a new Zap and select **Webhooks by Zapier** as the trigger event.
   - Search for _“Webhooks by Zapier”_ if it’s not visible.
3. Choose the **Catch Hook** trigger type and click **Continue**.
4. Copy the webhook URL provided by Zapier.

## Step 5: Paste the Webhook URL in Phonely

1. Return to the Phonely platform and paste the webhook URL into the **Webhook URL** field of the Zapier block.
2. Click **Test Webhook** in Phonely to ensure the webhook is successfully linked.
3. Go back to Zapier and click **Test Trigger** to confirm the connection. Zapier should display the incoming data from Phonely.

## Step 6: Customize the Data Sent to Zapier

1. Define the specific fields to send to Zapier:
   - For example, you may include the customer’s first name, email, phone number, or answers to specific questions in the workflow.
2. Click on each field in Phonely, select the relevant variable (e.g., _Customer Name_), and save your changes.

## Step 7: Create Actions in Zapier

1. Add an action to your Zap. For example:
   - Send an email using Gmail.
   - Update a database or trigger another app integration.
2. Map the variables sent from Phonely to the required fields in the action (e.g., populate the recipient email with the customer’s email variable).

## Step 8: Test and Deploy

1. Test your setup:
   - Click **Test Webhook** in Phonely and ensure that the correct data is sent to Zapier.
   - In Zapier, test your actions to verify that they work as expected.
2. Once testing is successful, save and activate your workflow in Phonely.

## Key Notes

- **Live Call vs. Post Call Actions**: Use Live Call actions for immediate triggers during the call, and Post Call actions for processes that require access to call data.
- **Customization**: You can tailor the fields sent to Zapier to ensure only relevant information is passed.
