## Introduction

Good flow design is the foundation of successful AI phone agents. This guide covers essential principles for creating intuitive, effective conversation flows that provide value to your callers.

## Core Design Principles

**1. Keep It Simple**

<Info>
  **Rule of Thumb:** If you can't explain your flow in 30 seconds, it's probably too complex.
</Info>

**Best Practices:**
- Limit decision points to 3-4 options maximum
- Use clear, conversational language
- Avoid technical jargon
- Provide obvious next steps

**2. Start with the End in Mind**

Before building your flow, clearly define:
- What is the primary goal of this conversation?
- What information do you need to collect?
- What action should the caller take?
- How will you know the call was successful?

**3. Design for Real Conversations**

Real phone conversations are dynamic and unpredictable. Design your flows to handle:

    Callers may interrupt or ask questions at any time

  <Card title="Clarifications" icon="question">

## Flow Structure Guidelines

**• Opening Strong** - Your first 10 seconds determine the entire call experience

**Good Opening:**
> "Hi! I'm your AI assistant from [Company]. I'm here to help you [specific purpose]. How can I assist you today?"

**Avoid:**
> "Welcome to our automated system. Please listen carefully as our menu options have changed..."

**• Logical Flow Progression** - Structure your conversation in a logical sequence

1. **Greeting & Purpose** - Set expectations
2. **Information Gathering** - Collect what you need
3. **Processing** - Handle the request
4. **Confirmation** - Verify understanding
5. **Next Steps** - Clear action items
6. **Closing** - Professional ending

**• Effective Information Collection**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask One Thing at a Time">
    Don't overwhelm callers with multiple questions. Ask for one piece of information, wait for the response, then ask for the next.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Context">
    Explain why you need the information: "I need your account number to look up your order status."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer Alternatives">
    Give options when possible: "You can provide your account number or the phone number associated with your account."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

**• Graceful Degradation** - Always provide fallback options when things don't go as planned

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When Information Isn't Clear" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    - Ask for clarification: "I didn't catch that. Could you repeat your account number?"
    - Offer alternatives: "If you don't have your account number, I can help you with your phone number instead."
    - Provide human assistance: "Let me connect you with a human agent who can help."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When Systems Are Down" icon="server">
    - Acknowledge the issue: "I'm experiencing some technical difficulties right now."
    - Offer alternatives: "I can take your information and have someone call you back."
    - Provide contact information: "You can also reach us at [phone number] or [email]."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When Callers Are Frustrated" icon="face-frown">
    - Show empathy: "I understand this is frustrating."
    - Take responsibility: "I apologize for the confusion."
    - Offer solutions: "Let me try a different approach to help you."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Language Guidelines

**• Use Natural, Conversational Language**

**Good:**
- "I'd be happy to help you with that."
- "Let me look that up for you."
- "I understand you're looking for..."

**Avoid:**
- "Please hold while I process your request."
- "Invalid input detected."
- "System error 404."

**• Match Your Brand Voice**

Consider your company's personality:
- **Professional Services:** Formal, respectful, thorough
- **Tech Companies:** Friendly, efficient, helpful
- **Healthcare:** Caring, patient, clear
- **Retail:** Energetic, helpful, sales-focused

## Testing

**• Testing Checklist** - Before deploying your flow, test it with:

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>Real users (not just your team)</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Different age groups and technical comfort levels</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Various scenarios (happy path, edge cases, errors)</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Different phone types and connection qualities</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

**• Common Issues**

- **Dead Ends:** Can callers get stuck without options?
- **Confusing Language:** Are instructions clear to non-technical users?
- **Missing Information:** What happens when required data isn't available?
- **Long Waits:** Are processing times reasonable?
