## Introduction

Thorough testing is crucial for ensuring your AI phone agents work reliably in production. This guide covers testing strategies, tools, and best practices to help you catch issues before they impact your callers.

## Testing Philosophy

**• Test Early, Test Often**

<Info>
  **Golden Rule:** Every change should be tested before deployment, no matter how small.
</Info>

Testing should be integrated into your development workflow, not treated as an afterthought. The earlier you catch issues, the easier and cheaper they are to fix.

## Types of Testing

**1. Unit Testing**

Test individual blocks and components in isolation:

<CardGroup columns="2">
  <Card title="Block Configuration" icon="gear">
    Verify each block works with different input values and configurations.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Variable Handling" icon="code">
    Test how variables are passed between blocks and transformed.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="API Integrations" icon="plug">
    Ensure external API calls work with various response formats.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Error Conditions" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    Test how blocks handle unexpected inputs or failures.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**2. Integration Testing**

Test how different parts of your flow work together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Block Connections">
    Verify that blocks connect properly and data flows correctly between them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conditional Logic">
    Test all possible paths through your flow, including edge cases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="External Systems">
    Ensure integrations with databases, APIs, and other services work as expected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**3. End-to-End Testing**

Test complete user journeys from start to finish:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Happy Path Testing" icon="check-circle">
    Test the ideal user journey where everything goes smoothly:
    - User calls in
    - Provides correct information
    - Receives expected response
    - Call ends successfully
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error Path Testing" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    Test scenarios where things go wrong:
    - Invalid input provided
    - System timeouts
    - Network connectivity issues
    - User hangs up mid-conversation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Edge Case Testing" icon="question">
    Test unusual but possible scenarios:
    - Very long responses
    - Background noise
    - Multiple people on the call
    - Non-English speakers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Tools

**• Built-in Tools**

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Call Recording Analysis" icon="microphone">
    Review actual call recordings to identify issues and improvements.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Analytics Dashboard" icon="chart-bar">

**• Manual Testing**

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>Test with different phone types (landline, mobile, VoIP)</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Test with various connection qualities (good, poor, intermittent)</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Test with different user personas (technical, non-technical, elderly)</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Test during different times of day and days of the week</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Test with background noise and interruptions</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Test error scenarios and recovery paths</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

## Test Data

**• Creating Test Data**

<Warning>
  **Security Note:** Never use real customer data for testing. Always use anonymized or synthetic data.
</Warning>

**Best Practices:**
- Create representative sample data that covers various scenarios
- Include edge cases (very long names, special characters, etc.)
- Test with different data formats and languages
- Ensure test data reflects your actual user base demographics

**• Environment Setup**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Separate Test Environment">
    Use a dedicated test environment that mirrors production but with test data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Phone Numbers">
    Set up dedicated test phone numbers for different scenarios.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mock External Services">
    Use mock services for APIs and integrations during testing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Testing

**• Load Testing** - Test how your agents perform under various load conditions

<CardGroup columns="2">
  <Card title="Concurrent Calls" icon="users">
    Test with multiple simultaneous calls to ensure system stability.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Peak Hours" icon="clock">
    Simulate high-traffic periods to identify bottlenecks.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Long Conversations" icon="hourglass">
    Test extended conversations to check for memory leaks or timeouts.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rapid Succession" icon="bolt">
    Test quick back-to-back calls to verify system recovery.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**• Response Time Testing** - Monitor and optimize key performance metrics

- **Initial Response Time:** How quickly does the agent start speaking?
- **Processing Time:** How long does it take to process user input?
- **API Response Time:** How quickly do external integrations respond?
- **Total Call Duration:** Is the conversation efficient?

## User Testing

**• Beta Testing**

<Info>
  **Recommendation:** Run a beta test with a small group of real users before full deployment.
</Info>

**Beta Testing Process:**
1. **Recruit Testers:** Find representative users from your target audience
2. **Provide Instructions:** Give clear guidance on what to test and how to report issues
3. **Monitor Calls:** Listen to recordings and analyze performance data
4. **Collect Feedback:** Gather both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback
5. **Iterate:** Make improvements based on findings before full launch

**• Feedback**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quantitative Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    - Call completion rates
    - Average call duration
    - Error rates
    - User satisfaction scores
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Qualitative Feedback" icon="comments">
    - User interviews
    - Survey responses
    - Call recording analysis
    - Support ticket analysis
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Continuous Testing

**• Automated Testing** - Set up automated tests that run on every change

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-deployment Tests">
    Run automated tests before any deployment to production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smoke Tests">
    Quick tests to verify basic functionality after deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitoring">
    Continuous monitoring of production systems for issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**• Regression**

<Warning>
  **Important:** Always test that new changes don't break existing functionality.
</Warning>

**Regression Testing Strategy:**
- Maintain a comprehensive test suite that covers all critical paths
- Run full regression tests before major releases
- Use automated testing where possible to catch issues quickly
- Document and track all known issues and their fixes

## Documentation

**• Test Plans** - Keep detailed records of your testing activities

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>Test plan documentation with clear objectives</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Test case descriptions and expected results</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Actual test results and any deviations</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Issue tracking and resolution documentation</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Performance benchmarks and trends</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>
