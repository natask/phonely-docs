Post Call Actions are a powerful type of block that trigger specific automations after a phone conversation has concluded. Unlike Live Call Actions which happen in real-time during the call, Post Call Actions are designed to process and pass information once the call has finished.

## What are Post Call Actions?

Post Call Actions are actions that are taken after a phone conversation is complete, and are extremely valuable for automating follow-ups, capturing comprehensive call data, and integrating with other systems without interrupting the live conversation.

## Key Features and Purpose

**Trigger After Call**: The core function of a Post Call Action is to activate after the call has ended or reached a specific termination point in the workflow.

**Access to Rich Call Data**: Post Call Actions have access to a broader set of variables generated throughout the entire conversation, including:

- AI-generated summary of the call
- Full call transcript
- The call's URL (link to the recording in your Phonely dashboard)
- Analytics data (e.g., AI success rate, topics discussed)
- All variables stored from any blocks within the conversation.

**Pre-built Automations**: Phonely offers pre-built Post Call Actions such as sending emails, sending text messages, or integrating with external tools (like Zapier).

**Strategic Placement**: Post Call Actions are triggered only if the conversation reaches the specific node (connection point) where the Post Call Action is attached. This allows for conditional execution based on the caller's journey through the workflow.

**Preemptive Use**: You can place Post Call Actions at the beginning of a flow (e.g., connected to the "Start Flow" node). This allows you to capture initial data or trigger an action even if the caller doesn't complete the entire conversation, providing valuable insights (e.g., if a flow was started but not finished). If a variable isn't available (because the call didn't reach a block that would define it), it will simply indicate "not available."

## How to Set Up a Post Call Action

Adding a Post Call Action to your workflow is straightforward:

1. **Access Your Workflow**: Navigate to your desired workflow in Phonely's Agent Design tab.

2. **Click the Plus Button**: Click the + button that appears to the right-hand side of any block in your call flow.

3. **Select Action**: A menu will pop up with a series of pre-built Post Call Action blocks (e.g., "Send Email," "Send Text Message," "Zapier"). Select the desired action.

4. **Configure & Connect**: Once added, configure the settings of the Post Call Action block and ensure it is connected to the appropriate node in your workflow. You will know that your Post Call Action has successfully connected if there is a dotted line connected to your previous block.

## When are Post Call Actions Triggered?

It's crucial to understand the trigger mechanism for Post Call Actions:

**A Post Call Action is only triggered if the conversation successfully reaches the specific node to which that Post Call Action is attached.**

**Example**: If you have a Post Call "Send Text Message" connected to a specific "Appointment Confirmed" block, the text message will only be sent after the call finishes AND the caller successfully navigated to and completed the "Appointment Confirmed" block.

**Global vs. Specific**: If a Post Call Action is attached to the main "Start Flow" node (the far right node on your workflow canvas), it will be triggered for every conversation that starts that workflow. If it's attached to a node deeper in the workflow, it will only trigger if that specific path is taken.

## Conclusion

Post Call Actions are an incredibly valuable component of Phonely, enabling powerful automations that leverage comprehensive call data once the conversation is complete. By strategically utilizing these actions, you can enhance data capture, streamline follow-ups, and integrate your voice AI system seamlessly with your other business processes.
