In this guide, we'll introduce you to Phonely's Start Flow Block, the very first element in any inbound call flow.

## Key Functions

While seemingly simple, the Start Flow Block serves a crucial purpose for inbound call flows:

**• Initiating the Workflow** - It acts as the trigger for your automated call process. When a call is received, Phonely immediately looks to the Start Flow Block to know what to do next.

**• Setting the Stage** - Although it doesn't directly interact with the caller, the Start Flow Block often leads directly to the first point of interaction, usually a Talk Block where your AI agent will greet the caller.

**• Defining the Beginning** - It clearly marks the beginning of your defined call flow, making it easy to understand the logical progression of your automation.

**• Foundation for All Automation** - You cannot build any automated call workflow in Phonely without a Start Flow Block. It's the essential foundation upon which all other blocks and logic are built.

## Basic Usage

Using the Start Flow Block is straightforward:

**• It's Automatically Included** - When you create a new inbound workflow in the Agent Design tab, a Start Flow Block is automatically added to your canvas. You don't need to manually select or add it.

**• Connect to the Next Step** - The primary action you'll take with the Start Flow Block is to connect it to the next block in your desired call flow. This is typically a Talk Block, where you'll define the initial prompt for your AI agent to have a conversation with the caller.

You do this by dragging a connector line from the output node (usually a small circle) on the Start Flow Block to the input node of your next block.

**Example:** Imagine a simple workflow: `[Start Flow Block] --> [Talk Block: "How can I help you today?"]`

In this example, when a call comes in, the Start Flow Block initiates the workflow, and immediately directs the call to the Talk Block, where the AI agent delivers the initial greeting.

In essence, the Start Flow Block is the silent but essential beginning of every automated phone conversation in Phonely. It ensures that every call enters your carefully crafted workflow, ready to be handled by your AI agent. As you build more complex workflows, remember that the Start Flow Block is always the first step in providing a seamless and automated experience for your callers.
