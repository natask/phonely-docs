In this article, you will learn how to use Phonely's Transfer Call Block. The Transfer Call Block is a powerful tool that allows your AI agent to transfer calls to specific phone numbers or dynamically route calls using variables retrieved from external sources, such as APIs. This guide walks you through both straightforward and dynamic use cases for leveraging this essential feature in your automated workflows.

## What is it?

The Transfer Call Block allows your Phonely AI to hand off a live call directly to a human or another designated phone number, making it invaluable for routing callers to the right department, agent, or service.

## Key Features

The Transfer Call Block provides unparalleled flexibility for routing calls, making it an essential tool for automating and optimizing call center operations and customer service:

**• Dynamic Routing** - Automatically route calls to available representatives or departments by leveraging external APIs to fetch real-time phone numbers.

**• Call Outcome Tags** - Use tags to track transfer performance and generate detailed analytics in your dashboard, providing insights into success rates and common transfer reasons.

**• Custom Interim Messages** - Provide callers with updates (e.g., "Please hold while I connect you to a representative") while the transfer is in progress, improving the caller experience.

**• Error Handling** - Implement backup numbers or alternative workflows in case the primary transfer attempt or API request fails, ensuring the caller is never dropped abruptly.

## How to Use

The Transfer Call Block can be configured for both simple, static transfers and more complex, dynamic routing scenarios.

**• Simple Use Case: Basic Call Transfers**

This is the most straightforward application, where calls are transferred to a pre-defined phone number.

**1. Add the Transfer Call Block**

1. Navigate to the Workflows section in the Agent Design tab.
2. Add a Transfer Call block to your workflow by clicking the + button and selecting the block from the list.

**2. Configure Trigger Conditions**

Set trigger conditions within the preceding blocks in your workflow to determine when a call should be transferred.

**Example**: Transfer the call if the customer:
- Asks to speak with a person.
- Appears frustrated during the conversation.

**3. Add an Interim Message (Optional)**

Add a message that will play for the caller while the transfer is in progress, such as "Please hold while I connect you to a representative."

**4. Tag the Outcome**

Assign a Call Outcome Tag (e.g., "Sales Transfer") to track and analyze transferred calls in your dashboard and analytics, providing valuable insights.

**• Bonus: Department Transfers**

For routing to different departments, you can combine the Transfer Call Block with other Phonely features:

1. Add an Ask Exactly Block before the transfer to ask the caller which department they would like to reach (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Support).
2. Route calls to the appropriate department by duplicating the Transfer Call block and assigning specific department phone numbers to each branch.

**• Dynamic Use Case: Real-time Call Transfers via API**

This application is ideal for scenarios where target phone numbers are not fixed (e.g., routing to the next available agent in a call center) and need to be retrieved dynamically.

**1. Add an API Request Block**

1. Use the API Request Block in your workflow to fetch the required phone number from an external system.
2. Configure the API endpoint to return the phone number dynamically.

**Example**: The API may return a JSON response containing the number, such as:

```json
{ "number": "+1234567890" }
```

**2. Use the Retrieved Number in Transfer Call Block**

1. After the API Request Block, add the Transfer Call Block.
2. In the Phone Number Field, insert the variable returned by the API (e.g., `{{api_response.number}}`). This tells Phonely to use the number dynamically retrieved by the API.

**3. Test the Workflow**

1. Test the API request to ensure the phone number is correctly retrieved.
2. Simulate a call to verify that the call routes to the dynamically retrieved number.

## Warm Transfers

To set up a warm transfer within your Transfer Call Block, scroll to the bottom of the block, and select the Warm Transfer option. The Warm Transfer Block allows your agent to seamlessly hand over a live phone conversation to a human agent with a personalized introduction. This means the AI doesn't just connect the call; it acts as an intermediary, speaking to the receiving agent to provide context about the caller before the transfer is completed.

For detailed information about configuring warm transfers, including personalized handoffs, IVR detection, and intelligent fallback handling, see our comprehensive [Warm Transfer Block guide](/home/blocks/warm-transfer).

## Use Cases

The Transfer Call Block is an essential tool for automating and optimizing call center operations and diverse routing needs:

- **User Authentication**: Route callers to specific teams based on verified identity.
- **Qualification Processes**: Direct qualified leads to sales, while others are routed to a different support channel.
- **Complex Decision Trees**: Implement decision logic that leads to specialized human assistance based on multiple inputs.
- **Routing to Available Agents**: Dynamically connect callers to the next available representative in a call center queue.
- **Department-Based Routing**: Efficiently transfer callers to specific departments (e.g., Sales, Support, Billing).

## Conclusion

Phonely's Transfer Call Block provides unparalleled flexibility for routing calls, making it an essential tool for automating and optimizing call center operations, enhancing customer service, and ensuring callers reach the right human agent or destination efficiently.
