description: "How to Use Phonely's Zapier Block in Live Call Actions"
---

The Zapier Block in Phonely's platform allows you to seamlessly integrate your AI voice agent workflows with thousands of other applications via Zapier. This powerful block enables your Phonely agent to trigger automated actions (called "Zaps") in external systems during or after a phone call, connecting your voice interactions to your CRM, email system, marketing tools, databases, and more.

## What is it?

Essentially, the Zapier Block acts as a bridge, sending specific data collected during a Phonely call to Zapier, which then automates tasks in your other connected software. By connecting with Zapier, Phonely's capabilities become almost endless.

## Key Features

**• Extensive Integrations** - Connects Phonely to Zapier's vast ecosystem of over 5,000 applications for automated workflows.

**• Live Call & Post Call Actions**

**Live Call Actions:** Trigger Zaps immediately during the active phone conversation.

**Post Call Actions:** Trigger Zaps after the call has ended, providing access to additional post-call data like the full call recording link or complete transcript. (Often recommended for more comprehensive data transfer).

**• Customizable Data Transfer** - Choose to send all available call data to Zapier, or precisely select and customize which specific pieces of information (variables) are sent, optimizing payload size and relevance.

**• Variable Mapping** - Easily map variables collected by Phonely's other blocks (e.g., name, phone number, email from a Prompt or Multi-Ask Block) directly to fields in your Zapier action.

**• Phonely Call Link** - Automatically include a direct link to the call record in your Phonely dashboard within the data sent to Zapier, allowing for quick access to call details and recordings.

**• Interim Message** - Define a message that the AI agent says aloud while the Zapier action is being processed (e.g., "One moment while I check your information with Salesforce").

**• Call Outcome Tagging** - Tag the call at this stage for further analytics within Phonely's platform, helping you track workflow progression and Zapier integration success.

## How to Use

Setting up the Zapier Block involves configuring both your Phonely workflow and your Zapier account to communicate effectively.

**1. Navigate to the Workflows Tab in Phonely**

1. Log in to your Phonely account at app.phonely.ai.
2. Go to the **Agent Designer** section and click on the **Workflows** tab.
3. Select the specific workflow where you'd like to add the Zapier block.

**2. Add a Zapier Block in Phonely**

1. Identify the stage in your workflow where you want the Zapier action to trigger.
2. Click the **plus (+)** button at that stage.
3. Choose either **Live Call Actions** or **Post Call Actions** from the menu.

> **Note:** While Live Call actions occur immediately, Post Call actions have access to more comprehensive call data (e.g., call recording, full transcript, call summary), making them valuable for many Zapier integrations.

**3. Get the Webhook URL from Zapier**

1. Log in to your Zapier account.
2. Create a new Zap.
3. As the Trigger for your Zap, search for and select **"Webhooks by Zapier."**
4. Choose the **"Catch Hook"** trigger type and click **Continue**. This tells Zapier to listen for incoming data.
5. Zapier will then provide you with a unique Webhook URL. Copy this URL.

**4. Configure the Zapier Block in Phonely**

1. Return to the Phonely platform and click on the Zapier Block you added.
2. **Webhook URL:** Paste the copied Webhook URL from Zapier into the "Webhook URL" field of the Zapier block.
3. **Customize Data Sent to Zapier:**
   
   You have two options here:
   
   - **Send Full Data:** (Default) This option sends all available post-call information or live-call variables to Zapier.
   - **Customize Fields:** (Recommended for precision) Define specific fields to send. This allows you to send only the relevant data, optimizing the payload. To do this, you'll specify a Name (which acts as a key in a JSON body, e.g., "customer_phone") and its Value (which will be a Phonely variable, e.g., [customer_phone_number]).
   
   **Example Custom Fields:**
   - Name: `full_name`, Value: `[full_name_variable]` (e.g., from a Prompt Block)
   - Name: `email_address`, Value: `[customer_email_variable]`
   - Name: `phone_number`, Value: `[customer_phone_number_variable]`
   - Name: `call_dashboard_link`, Value: `[dashboard_url]` (Phonely's direct link to the call record)

4. **Add Interim Message (Optional):** Enter a message the AI will say during the Zapier processing (e.g., "One moment while I confirm your details.").
5. **Add Call Outcome Tagging (Optional):** Define a tag for analytics to track when the call reaches this block (e.g., "Zapier_Triggered").

**5. Test the Webhook Connection**

1. In Phonely, click **"Test Webhook"** within the Zapier block's settings.

> **Note:** You can input dummy data for your custom fields during testing to see how it will appear in Zapier.

2. Go back to Zapier and click **"Test Trigger."** Zapier should now successfully receive the incoming data from Phonely, displaying the fields you configured.

**6. Create Actions in Zapier**

1. After the Webhook trigger is successfully set up in Zapier, add an Action to your Zap.
2. **Example Actions:** Send an email using Gmail, create a contact in Salesforce, update a Google Sheet, add an entry to a CRM, or trigger another app integration.
3. **Map Variables:** In your Zapier action, map the variables sent from Phonely (which Zapier received from the webhook) to the required fields in your chosen application. For example, populate the recipient email with the email_address variable received from Phonely.

**7. Final Test and Deploy**

1. **Test Your Setup:**
   - Click **"Test Webhook"** in Phonely again to send real or dummy data.
   - In Zapier, test your action steps to verify that they work as expected (e.g., confirming the email is sent, or the CRM entry is created).
2. Once testing is successful, save and activate your workflow in Phonely. Your Zap will now automatically run every time a call reaches this block in your Phonely workflow.

## Conclusion

The Zapier Block is one of Phonely's most valuable features, enabling seamless, powerful automation between your voice AI agent and your entire business ecosystem. By sending specific call data to Zapier, you can trigger a myriad of actions, automate lead management, streamline follow-ups, and ensure critical information is always where it needs to be, vastly extending the capabilities of your AI receptionist.

## Key Notes

- **Live Call vs. Post Call Actions**: Use Live Call actions for immediate triggers during the call, and Post Call actions for processes that require access to call data.
- **Customization**: You can tailor the fields sent to Zapier to ensure only relevant information is passed.
