## Overview

With this integration, you can:

- Look up order information in real time, such as status, shipping date, or product details.
- Automate responses to common order inquiries without human intervention.
- Leverage Google Sheets to store and organize data for seamless integration with Phonely.

## Setup

**1. Set a Trigger in the Workflow**

1. Navigate to **Agent Design** and select the **Workflows** tab.
2. Create a new **Start Flow Block** and configure it to trigger when a customer asks about their order.
   - For example, the workflow could activate when the customer mentions _"order status"_ or similar phrases.

**2. Gather the Customer's Order Number**

1. Use a **Question Block** to ask the customer for their order number.
2. Save the response as a variable (e.g., `order_number`).
   - You can use alternative blocks like **Multi-Ask** or **Prompt blocks**, but in this example, we're using a **Question Block** for simplicity.

\> **Pro Tip:** Encourage customers to spell out their order number for better transcription accuracy.

**3. Connect to Google Sheets**

1. Integrate your Google Sheet with Phonely by selecting the **Google Sheets Integration** option in the Workflow menu.
2. Use the **Search a Row** function to:
   - Retrieve data from a specific column in the spreadsheet (e.g., match the `order_number` variable).
   - Search across all rows and columns to find relevant information.
3. Sync the spreadsheet by selecting the file and tab you want to use. If needed, click **Reconnect** to refresh the connection.

_Optional:_ Choose whether to include all Google Sheets data in the AI agent's context. This can help the AI reference the data more dynamically during the call.

**4. Display the Information**

1. Add a **Prompt Block** to inform the customer of their order details.
2. Use variables pulled from Google Sheets, such as:
   - **Order Status:** "Your order is currently [shipped, processing, etc.]."
   - **Shipping Date:** "It is scheduled to ship on [date]."
   - **Product Name or ID:** Include additional details if necessary.

**5. Customize the Output**

- Include as many details as needed, such as product descriptions, estimated delivery dates, or tracking links.
- Ensure all information dynamically updates in real time, thanks to the synced Google Sheet.

## Example Use Case

A customer calls to check the status of their order:

1. The AI prompts the customer for their order number.
2. Using the Google Sheets integration, Phonely retrieves the order status, shipping date, and other relevant information.
3. The AI informs the customer:
   - “Your order is currently **shipped**. It was dispatched on **January 10th** and is expected to arrive by **January 15th**.”

## Pro Tips

1. **Automate Updates:** Use tools like Zapier to automatically update your Google Sheets with new order data from your CRM or shipping provider.
2. **Include Multiple Variables:** Add as much relevant data as possible (e.g., product details, tracking numbers) for a more comprehensive response.
3. **Optimize Workflow Logic:** Use filters to ensure accurate matches between customer input and your data.

## Conclusion

With Phonely’s Google Sheets integration, you can automate complex tasks, such as order tracking, and provide real-time, accurate updates to your customers. This setup reduces the need for manual intervention, saving time and improving customer satisfaction.
