In this page, we'll guide you through the Time Filter Block in Phonely. This block allows your AI agent to dynamically filter the conversation and apply different routing instructions based upon the time of day. It's an essential tool for managing caller experiences during and outside of specific operating hours, lunch breaks, or other time-sensitive scenarios.

## What is it?

This one's a little intuitive, but in case you need to hear it… The Time Filter Block essentially acts as a gatekeeper, directing the conversational flow down different paths depending on whether the current time falls within or outside of predefined time ranges. This ensures callers receive appropriate assistance regardless of when they call.

## Key Features

**• Time-Based Routing** - Automatically directs the conversation based on custom-defined timeframes, ensuring seamless transitions between different operational modes (e.g., business hours, after-hours).

**• True/False Outcomes** - Provides distinct output paths:

- **True**: When the current time falls within the set time range(s).
- **False**: When the current time falls outside the set time range(s).

**• Flexible Time Configuration** - Easily adjust and set specific start and end times for each day of the week.

**• Multiple Time Ranges** - Add multiple distinct time blocks for a single day (e.g., for lunch breaks or varying shifts).

**• Disconnection Option** - Disconnect a time range if you do not want any routing available during those specific hours.

**• Seamless Integration** - Easily links with other Phonely blocks such as the Transfer Call Block, Prompt Block, or End Call Block to execute specific actions based on the time.

## How to Use

Using the Time Filter Block involves defining your operational hours and connecting the appropriate workflow paths.

**1. Add a Time Filter Block**

1. Navigate to your workflow in the Agent Design tab.
2. Click the + button to add a new block.
3. Select the "Time Filter Block" from the available options.

**2. Configure Time Ranges**

Within the block's settings, you will see a calendar interface to define your time ranges.

- **Set Daily Hours**: For each day of the week, adjust the sliders or input exact times to set the desired "open" hours.
- **Add Multiple Ranges**: If you have breaks or multiple shifts within a day (e.g., open from 9 AM-12 PM and 1 PM-5 PM), click the + button to add additional time blocks for that specific day.
- **Disconnect Times**: If you want no action to occur during a specific time block, ensure it is disconnected from any output path. The AI will not route through any "true" path for disconnected times.

**3. Define Outcome Paths**

- Connect subsequent blocks from the "True" path for actions that should occur when the time falls within your configured range(s).
- Connect subsequent blocks from the "False" path for actions that should occur when the time falls outside your configured range(s).

## Example Use Case

A common application of the Time Filter Block is to manage customer support interactions based on business hours:

**• Initial Flow** - The call enters your Phonely AI workflow.

**• Time Filter Block** - Configure this block with your customer support operating hours (e.g., Monday-Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM).

**• Outcome Paths**

**True Path (Within Business Hours):**
- Connect to a Transfer Call Block to route the caller to a live customer support agent.
- **Alternatively**: Connect to a Prompt Block that offers more advanced AI-driven support or a scheduling option during business hours.

**False Path (After Business Hours):**
- Connect to a Prompt Block to inform the caller that support is closed and offer alternatives (e.g., leave a voicemail, direct to FAQs, provide emergency contact info).
- Connect to an End Call Block if no further interaction is desired after hours.

## Call Outcome Tags

The Time Filter Block also supports call outcome tagging, which is vital for improving the analytics and performance of your voice AI system.

**• Purpose** - By tagging this block, you can track how many calls are routed through the "True" or "False" paths, giving you insights into caller behavior during different times.

**• Analytics** - This information is invaluable for analyzing call volume distribution, optimizing staffing, and assessing the effectiveness of your after-hours solutions in Phonely's analytics section.

## Conclusion

The Time Filter Block is a simple yet incredibly powerful tool within Phonely for creating intelligent and adaptive call flows that respond to the time of day. By precisely controlling conversational routing based on your operational hours, you can ensure a consistent and optimized experience for every caller, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.
