# Call Routing, Transfers, and Escalation

Phonely’s AI agents can automate most calls, but some conversations require a human. Escalation isn’t a weakness — it’s how you guarantee that customers always have a path to resolution. With call routing, transfer, and escalation features, you can decide when the AI continues handling a call and when it hands off to your team.

<Callout type="info">
Use transfers to build trust. A well-placed escalation shows customers that your AI works *with* your team, not instead of it.
</Callout>

## Transfer Call Block

The **Transfer Call** block is your primary tool for moving a call from AI to a human.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Cold Transfer">
    Forwards the caller directly to a number. Fast and simple, but without context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warm Transfer">
    Introduces the caller to the agent before connecting. Example: <i>“Hi, I have John on the line with a billing question.”</i>
  </Card>
</Cards>

Warm transfers support advanced options like voicemail detection. If voicemail picks up, the caller doesn’t get dropped — Phonely stays on the line, then resumes the conversation with fallback messaging.

## Global Transfer Flows

Sometimes escalation should be available anywhere, not just at specific points.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="What are Global Flows?">
    Global Flows can interrupt any conversation when conditions are met, moving the caller into a dedicated transfer flow.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="When to use them">
    Perfect for situations like:
    - Caller requests support mid-conversation
    - Caller asks for a specific team member
    - Caller frustration is detected
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Conditional Transfers

Transfers can also be controlled by rules. The most common is business hours.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Time Filter">
    Place a Time Filter block before your Transfer Call block.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set business hours">
    Define days and times when transfers are allowed (e.g., 9 AM – 9 PM).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define fallback">
    If outside of hours, the AI continues with a message like: <i>“Our team isn’t available right now, but I can take a message.”</i>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Conditions aren’t limited to time. You can configure escalation for frustration detection, keyword triggers, or business policy requirements.

## Example: Appointment Scheduling Flow

Here’s a practical flow that combines multiple transfer techniques:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Step 1: Confirm intent">
    Use a Talk block to ask who the caller wants to reach — support, technical team, or a specific person.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Step 2: Route options">
    Create Transfer Call blocks for each choice with the correct phone number configured.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Step 3: Add professionalism">
    Enable warm transfers so the caller is introduced before connecting.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Step 4: Plan for failures">
    Configure voicemail detection and fallback Talk blocks if no one answers.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Advanced Options

Transfer blocks allow for fine-grained control over edge cases.

<Properties>
  <Property name="voicemail_detection" type="boolean">
    Detects voicemail and returns the caller to the flow with a custom message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="transfer_failures" type="handler">
    Defines what happens if the transfer cannot be completed (e.g., retry, fallback message).
  </Property>
  <Property name="ivr_detection" type="boolean">
    Handles scenarios where the destination number has its own phone tree.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Best Practices

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Think of escalation as part of the experience">
    A warm transfer feels like the AI is part of your team, not just a gatekeeper.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Always configure fallbacks">
    No call should ever end in silence. Define clear next steps if transfers fail.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Use Global Flows strategically">
    Keep escalation available when it matters most, but avoid over-triggering.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
