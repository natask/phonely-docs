# Call Routing, Transfers, and Escalation

Most calls can be automated with Phonely’s AI agents, but no automation system covers every scenario. A frustrated customer, a request for a specific team member, or a policy that requires human sign-off are all situations where escalation is necessary. Phonely makes it simple to design call flows that are both efficient and flexible: the AI handles routine calls while ensuring humans are available when needed.

<info>
  Escalation is not a fallback of last resort. It is a deliberate part of your call design, ensuring every customer journey has a safe path to resolution.

## Transfers inside a Flow

The starting point for escalation is the **Transfer Call** block. You can drop this block into any flow where you want the AI to hand a call to a human.

<Card title="Cold Transfer">
  Forwards the call directly to a number. Use this when speed matters more than context.
</Card>

<Card title="Warm Transfer">
  Connects the caller after a short introduction. Example: “Hi, I have John on the line with a billing question.” This approach builds trust and avoids abrupt handoffs.
</Card>

Warm transfers support advanced features such as voicemail detection. If voicemail picks up, the AI does not abandon the caller. Instead, it resumes the conversation with a fallback message, such as “It looks like no one is available right now, but I can take a message.”

## Global Transfer Flows

Transfers don’t always happen in predictable places. A caller may ask for support halfway through an appointment booking flow, or the AI may detect rising frustration at any point. For these cases, Phonely supports **Global Flows**.

A Global Flow is always listening in the background. When its conditions are met — such as the caller saying “I need support” or mentioning a colleague’s name — the current flow is interrupted and the call is routed to the Global Flow. This makes escalation feel natural and responsive instead of rigid.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="When to use Global Flows">
  Use a Global Flow when you want escalation to be available at any time, regardless of where the caller is in the conversation.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="How to configure">
  Create a new flow, mark it as global, and define the triggers that should cause calls to jump into it. Add transfer logic inside that flow just as you would in any other.
</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Transfer Types

Phonely supports two main types of transfers. Both can be added with the **Transfer Call** block in your Flow Builder.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Cold Transfer">
    A direct pass-through. The call is forwarded immediately to the destination number with no introduction.

    <br />

    <br />

    Use cold transfers when speed is more important than context, such as forwarding general inquiries to a receptionist line.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Warm Transfer">
    A contextual handoff. The AI briefly introduces the caller before connecting.

    <br />

    <br />

    For example: “Hi Sarah, I have John on the line with a billing question.”

    <br />

    <br />

    Warm transfers can also detect voicemail. If no one picks up, the AI quietly resumes the call and lets the customer know someone will follow up.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Adding Conditions

Transfers often depend on context. The most common example is business hours. You may want calls to route to your support team from 9 AM to 9 PM, but outside of those hours, the AI should handle the request differently.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Time Filter block">
    Insert the block before your Transfer Call block in the flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your business hours">
    Define the days and hours when transfers are allowed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure fallback">
    Outside of business hours, route the caller to a Talk block that explains the team is unavailable and offers to take a message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This approach ensures that transfers only occur when someone is available to answer. Similar conditions can be applied to frustration detection, caller intent, or other business rules.

## Example Flow

Consider an appointment scheduling flow that also needs escalation options. Here is how you might design it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Step 1: Confirm intent">
    Use a Talk block to ask the caller who they want to speak with — for example, customer support, technical support, or a specific person.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Step 2: Route by choice">
    Create a Transfer Call block for each option. Assign the correct phone number to each destination.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Step 3: Handle with care">
    Configure each Transfer Call block as a warm transfer so the caller is introduced before being connected.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Step 4: Protect against failure">
    Enable voicemail detection. Add a Talk block after failed transfers to let the caller know no one is available and log their message.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This design combines automation with human support. Callers get fast service when the AI can help and a graceful handoff when it cannot.

---

## Advanced Options

Transfer Call blocks come with additional controls that improve reliability.

<Properties>
  <Property name="voicemail_detection" type="boolean">
    Detects voicemail and brings the caller back into the flow with a fallback message.
  </Property>

  <Property name="transfer_failures" type="action">
    Defines what happens if a transfer cannot connect. For example, retry once or send the call to a fallback Talk block.
  </Property>

  <Property name="ivr_detection" type="boolean">
    Detects if the destination number has an IVR (phone tree) and handles it appropriately.
  </Property>
</Properties>

These options ensure that escalation is never the end of the conversation. Even when transfers fail, callers remain supported.

---

## Best Practices

Phonely’s transfer features are flexible, but good design makes them effective. A few guidelines:

- Use warm transfers in customer-facing scenarios where context matters.
- Always configure fallbacks so that no call ends in silence.
- Apply Time Filters or other conditions to avoid unnecessary transfers.
- Treat escalation as part of the customer journey, not an exception to it.

<warning>
  Failing to set fallbacks can result in dropped calls. Always define what should happen if a transfer does not complete.
</warning>

# Summary

Call routing, transfers, and escalation transform AI automation from a closed system into a flexible, human-aware experience. Cold transfers are fast, warm transfers are professional, Global Flows provide responsiveness at any point, and Time Filters give you control over when transfers should occur. By layering in advanced options such as voicemail detection and transfer failure handling, you can design flows that never leave a caller unsupported.
